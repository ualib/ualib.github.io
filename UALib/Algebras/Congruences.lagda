### <a id="congruence-relations">Congruence Relations</a>
This section presents the [Algebras.Congruences][] module of the [Agda Universal Algebra Library][].

\begin{code}

{-# OPTIONS --without-K --exact-split --safe #-}

module Algebras.Congruences where

open import Algebras.Products public

module congruences {𝑆 : Signature 𝓞 𝓥} where
 open products {𝑆 = 𝑆} public

\end{code}

A *congruence relation* of an algebra `𝑨` is defined to be an equivalence relation that is compatible with the basic operations of `𝑨`.  This concept can be represented in a number of alternative but equivalent ways.
Formally, we define a record type (`IsCongruence`) to represent the property of being a congruence, and we define a Sigma type (`Con`) to represent the type of congruences of a given algebra.

\begin{code}

 record IsCongruence (𝑨 : Algebra 𝓤 𝑆)(θ : Rel ∣ 𝑨 ∣ 𝓦) : Set(ov 𝓦 ⊔ 𝓤)  where
  constructor mkcon
  field       is-equivalence : IsEquivalence θ
              is-compatible  : compatible 𝑨 θ

 Con : (𝑨 : Algebra 𝓤 𝑆) → Set(𝓤 ⊔ ov 𝓦)
 Con {𝓤}{𝓦} 𝑨 = Σ θ ꞉ ( Rel ∣ 𝑨 ∣ 𝓦 ) , IsCongruence 𝑨 θ


\end{code}

Each of these types captures what it means to be a congruence and they are equivalent in the sense that each implies the other. One implication is the "uncurry" operation and the other is the second projection.

\begin{code}

 IsCongruence→Con : {𝑨 : Algebra 𝓤 𝑆}(θ : Rel ∣ 𝑨 ∣ 𝓦) → IsCongruence 𝑨 θ → Con 𝑨
 IsCongruence→Con θ p = θ , p

 Con→IsCongruence : {𝑨 : Algebra 𝓤 𝑆} → ((θ , _) : Con{𝓤}{𝓦} 𝑨) → IsCongruence 𝑨 θ
 Con→IsCongruence θ = ∥ θ ∥

\end{code}

#### <a id="example">Example</a>
We defined the *zero relation* `𝟎` in the [Relations.Discrete][] module.  We now build the *trivial congruence*, which has `𝟎` as its underlying relation. Observe that `𝟎` is equivalent to the identity relation `≡` and these are obviously both equivalence relations. In fact, we already proved this of `≡` in the [Overture.Equality][] module, so we simply apply the corresponding proofs.

\begin{code}

 𝟎-IsEquivalence : {A : Set 𝓤} →  IsEquivalence {A = A} 𝟎
 𝟎-IsEquivalence = record {rfl = refl; sym = ≡-sym; trans = ≡-trans}

\end{code}

Next we formally record another obvious fact---that `𝟎-rel` is compatible with all operations of all algebras.

\begin{code}

 𝟎-compatible-op : funext 𝓥 𝓤 → {𝑨 : Algebra 𝓤 𝑆} (𝑓 : ∣ 𝑆 ∣) → (𝑓 ̂ 𝑨) |: 𝟎
 𝟎-compatible-op fe {𝑨} 𝑓 {i}{j} ptws0  = ap (𝑓 ̂ 𝑨) (fe ptws0)

 𝟎-compatible : funext 𝓥 𝓤 → {𝑨 : Algebra 𝓤 𝑆} → compatible 𝑨 𝟎
 𝟎-compatible fe {𝑨} = λ 𝑓 args → 𝟎-compatible-op fe {𝑨} 𝑓 args

\end{code}

Finally, we have the ingredients need to construct the zero congruence of any algebra we like.

\begin{code}

 Δ : (𝑨 : Algebra 𝓤 𝑆){fe : funext 𝓥 𝓤} → IsCongruence 𝑨 𝟎
 Δ 𝑨 {fe} = mkcon 𝟎-IsEquivalence (𝟎-compatible fe)

 𝟘 : (𝑨 : Algebra 𝓤 𝑆){fe : funext 𝓥 𝓤} → Con{𝓤} 𝑨
 𝟘 𝑨 {fe} = IsCongruence→Con 𝟎 (Δ 𝑨 {fe})

\end{code}


A concrete example is `⟪𝟎⟫[ 𝑨 ╱ θ ]`, presented in the next subsection.

#### <a id="quotient-algebras">Quotient algebras</a>
In many areas of abstract mathematics the *quotient* of an algebra `𝑨` with respect to a congruence relation `θ` of `𝑨` plays an important role. This quotient is typically denoted by `𝑨 / θ` and Agda allows us to define and express quotients using this standard notation.<sup>[1](Algebras.Congruences.html#fn1)</sup>

\begin{code}

 _╱_ : (𝑨 : Algebra 𝓤 𝑆) → Con{𝓤}{𝓦} 𝑨 → Algebra (𝓤 ⊔ lsuc 𝓦) 𝑆

 𝑨 ╱ θ = (∣ 𝑨 ∣ / ∣ θ ∣)  ,                               -- the domain of the quotient algebra
         λ 𝑓 𝑎 → ⟪ (𝑓 ̂ 𝑨)(λ i →  fst ∥ 𝑎 i ∥) ⟫           -- the basic operations of the quotient algebra

\end{code}

**Example**. If we adopt the notation `𝟎[ 𝑨 ╱ θ ]` for the zero (or identity) relation on the quotient algebra `𝑨 ╱ θ`, then we define the zero relation as follows.

\begin{code}


 𝟘[_╱_] : (𝑨 : Algebra 𝓤 𝑆)(θ : Con{𝓤}{𝓦} 𝑨) → Rel (∣ 𝑨 ∣ / ∣ θ ∣)(𝓤 ⊔ lsuc 𝓦)
 𝟘[ 𝑨 ╱ θ ] = λ u v → u ≡ v

\end{code}

From this we easily obtain the zero congruence of `𝑨 ╱ θ` by applying the `Δ` function defined above.

\begin{code}

 𝟎[_╱_] : (𝑨 : Algebra 𝓤 𝑆)(θ : Con{𝓤}{𝓦} 𝑨){fe : funext 𝓥 (𝓤 ⊔ lsuc 𝓦)} → Con (𝑨 ╱ θ)
 𝟎[ 𝑨 ╱ θ ] {fe} = 𝟘[ 𝑨 ╱ θ ] , Δ (𝑨 ╱ θ) {fe}

\end{code}


Finally, the following elimination rule is sometimes useful.

\begin{code}

 module _ {𝑨 : Algebra 𝓤 𝑆} where
  open IsCongruence

  /-≡ : (θ : Con{𝓤}{𝓦} 𝑨){u v : ∣ 𝑨 ∣} → ⟪ u ⟫ {∣ θ ∣} ≡ ⟪ v ⟫ → ∣ θ ∣ u v
  /-≡ θ refl = IsEquivalence.rfl (is-equivalence ∥ θ ∥)

\end{code}
